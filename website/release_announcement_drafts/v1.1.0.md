We're pleased to announce a new release of JBrowse Web!

We now use Jexl to express configuration callbacks. This is technically a
breaking change to use Jexl for configuration callbacks instead of JavaScript.

See our configuration guide here for details
([configuration guide](docs/config_guide#configuration-callbacks))

We also have several other improvements including the ability to get intron and
upstream/downstream sequence in the feature details

Another new update is the first release of our interactive Storybook docs for the embeddable React Linear Genome View.
The docs contain live examples of how the LGV component can be used, along with source-code examples.
The site can be found [here](https://jbrowse.org/storybook/lgv/v1.1.0).
