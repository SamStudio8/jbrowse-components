I'm pleased to announce a new release of JBrowse Web!

We now use jexl to express configuration callbacks. This is technically a
breaking change to use jexl for configuration callbacks instead of javascript.

See our configuration guide here for details
([configuration guide](docs/config_guide#configuration-callbacks))

We also have several other improvements including the ability to get intron and
upstream/downstream sequence in the feature details
