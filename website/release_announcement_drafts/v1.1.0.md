We're pleased to announce a new release of JBrowse Web!

## Changed callbacks language from JavaScript to Jexl

We now use [Jexl](https://github.com/TomFrost/Jexl/blob/master/README.md) to express configuration callbacks. Note that this is a breaking change, `function()`-style callbacks will no longer work.

For details, see the [callbacks section of our configuration guide](../docs/config_guide#configuration-callbacks).

## Fetch intron and upstream/downstream sequences

We also have several other improvements including the ability to get intron and
upstream/downstream sequence in the feature details

## Interactive documentation using Storybook

Another new update is the first release of our interactive Storybook docs for the embeddable React Linear Genome View.
The docs contain live examples of how the LGV component can be used, along with source-code examples.
The site can be found [here](https://jbrowse.org/storybook/lgv/v1.1.0).
